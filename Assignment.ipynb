    "**A\\*** is a heuristic search algorithm for increasing the efficiency of Djikstra’s algorithm for pathfinding and graph traversal. Here heuristic information means to find a suitable or an intuitive function that helps us to find the shortest path between 2 nodes in a graph, efficiently. It is used in gaming applications especially to design the movements of agents when they are aiming to reach a goal. It is used in network connection systems for sending packets between routers, cost effectively. It also helps robots in navigation$^{[1]}$. It uses the heuristic cost of greedy best first search algorithm and exact cost of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path. It calculates the heuristic distance from node **n** to the end node and exact cost from start node to **n**.\n",

After updating the distance in the graph, we will calculate the shortest path.\n",

    "Pathfinding is a crucial part in Video Games. A* is one of the widely used algorithms in games especially when it involves path-finding problems such as moving characters from one grid point to another grid point. Due to the exponential growth in complexity of the games, researchers focused on improving the A* algorithm to meet the demands of modern games. Many of the optimizations include improving heuristic functions, map representations(search space), introducing new data structures and reducing memory consumptions.$^{[3]}$\n",

    "\n",
    "<p>The A* Algorithm was invented by Bertram Raphael (Goldstein, A., 1991, July 25). It was Invented in the early 1970s as part of development of “Shakey the Robot”, a rather uninspired name for an early robot used for navigating rooms autonomously, funded by DARPA (DARPA). <br>\n",
    "Much like the Boston Dynamics robots making the news today, this robot was supposed to be science fiction turned into reality. While primitive, it navigated essentially the same as modern robots and self-driving cars do today. It had a destination in mind it was trying to reach, and a collection of sensors informing it of occupied spaces, i.e. obstacles. This set the stage for A*.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Shakey the Robot found its path by pointing and heading into the direction of the end point where it wanted to go, and finding the most optimal route around obstacles it encountered by looking left and right around the obstacles to get a sense for its surroundings. [3]\n",
    "This is in essence how the A* algorithm works today, by imitating the movements and actions of Shakey the robot looking to its destination, and shaking around once it encounters an obstacle. "

    "### Implementation (Daniel Sedlov 123120712)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to search for a path, each having their own benefits, however the strength of the A* algorithm comes from the guarantee that it finds the shortest path on a grid more efficiently than other algorithms, given a known start and end point. At a high level, it achieves this by first assuming there are no obstacles, and simply moving in that direction. \n",
    "Once it inevitably encounters an obstacle, it searches around it to find the shortest path. Crucially, it is not greedy. This means that when it finds a short path around the obstacle, it doesn’t lock in that path, so if later it finds too many other detours, it is willing to go back and take a path that is longer in the short term, to find a path shorter overall."

    "\n",
    "We assume that all squares in this grid can be in one of 3 states: open, closed, or not considered.\n",
    "Open means that we have not yet explored that cell but it in the queue of options. \n",

    "Not considered simply means neither open nor closed, we have not explored it yet, and we’re not really thinking about it yet either.\n",

    "For any of the algorithm to make sense, we have to prioritise the order in which we explore the open cells. This means that unlike a simple breadth search, we need a way to say “*this cell to the right has more promise than the cell to my left*”.\n",
    "Importantly, we also need to make sure that we have a mechanism to return to earlier points in the path, unlike a greedy pathfinding solution. [5]"

    "<p>Using hierarchical A*, we can reduce the search space hierarchically. For example, if we are going to Blackrock, Dublin from Kinsale, Cork (as shown in Fig 2.), by using A* implementation we will find all the cities in each county as nodes and find its heuristic function value to compute the shortest path between these two. If we use hierarchical A* algorithm, we can reduce the size of search space by considering its counties as its nodes, not the cities. First travel to the neighbourhood of the starting node i.e. boundary of Cork County. Then find the neighbourhood of the end node which is Dublin. After reaching the neighbourhood, travel to the end node i.e. Blackrock. As you can see we have eliminated the cities(nodes) that are not part of Cork and Dublin, and thus reduced search space dramatically resulting in higher efficiency. </p>\n",
