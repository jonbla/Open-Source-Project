    "**A\\*** is a heuristic search algorithm for increasing the efficiency of Djikstra’s algorithm for pathfinding and graph traversal. Here heuristic information means to find a suitable or an intuitive function that helps us to find the shortest path between 2 nodes in a graph, efficiently. It is used in gaming applications especially to design the movements of agents when they are aiming to reach a goal. It is used in network connection systems for sending packets between routers, cost effectively. It also helps robots in navigation$^{[1]}$. It uses the heuristic cost of greedy best first search algorithm and exact cost of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path. It calculates the heuristic distance from node **n** to the end node and exact cost from start node to **n**.\n",

    "$Distance_{new}(start,v)$ is the new updated distance between start node and node **v**, $Distance_{old}(start,v)$ is the exact cost of reaching node **v** from start node and $Heuristic(v,end)$ is the heuristic cost of reaching to end node from **v**. After updating the distance in the graph, we will calculate the shortest path.\n",

    "<p>For finding optimal path between 2 cities or places, we can use A* search algorithm to calculate the shortest path between them. Here the heuristic function could be the air distance(euclidean distance) or great-circle distance between 2 cities.$^{[2]}$</p>\n",

    "<h4>Video Games</h4>\n",
    "Pathfinding is a crucial part in Video Games. A* is one of the widely used algorithms in games especially when it involves path-finding problems such as moving characters from one grid point to another grid point. Due to the exponential growth in complexity of the games, researchers focused on improving the A* algorithm to meet the demands of modern games. Many of the optimizations include improving heuristic functions, map representations(search space), introducing new data structures and reducing memory consumptions.$^{[3]}$\n",

    "<h4>Heirarchical Pathfinding A* (HPA*) .$^{[3]}$</h4>\n",
    "<p>Using hierarchical A*, we can reduce the search space hierarchically. For example, if we are going to Blackrock, Dublin from Kinsale, Cork (as shown in Fig 2.), by using A* implementation we will find all the cities in each county as nodes and find its heuristic function value to compute the shortest path between these two. If we use hierarchical A* algorithm, we can reduce the size of search space by considering its counties as its nodes, not the cities. First travel to the neighbourhood of the starting node i.e. boundary of Cork County. Then find the neighbourhood of the end node which is Dublin. After reaching the neighbourhood, travel to the end node i.e. Blackrock. As you can see we have eliminated the cities(nodes) that are not part of Cork and Dublin, and thus reduced search space dramatically resulting in higher efficiency. </p>\n",
